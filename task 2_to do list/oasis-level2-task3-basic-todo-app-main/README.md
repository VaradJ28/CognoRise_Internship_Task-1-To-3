# oasis-level2-task3-basic-todo-app
Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.  The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

# To-Do App
This is a simple To-Do web application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. Users can input tasks in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add them to the list of pending tasks. Each task item contains options to mark it as completed or delete it.

# Features
Add new tasks to the list.

Mark tasks as completed or pending.

Delete tasks from the list.

# Usage

Open the todoapp.html file in your web browser.

Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list of pending tasks.

Click on the "Complete" button next to a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will move to the "Completed Tasks" section.

Click on the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

# Customization
You can customize the styling and functionality of the To-Do app by modifying the CSS styles and JavaScript code in the provided HTML file according to your preferences.
